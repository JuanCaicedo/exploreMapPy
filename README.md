# exploreMapPy
see exploreMap, but think of this as phase 2 of the project. exploreMap phase 1 required me to hardcode the JSON, which was doable because I only tested on two states. In order to organize my data for all 52 states DOTs, I'll use Python to read a CSV file and write a JSON file, or, I'll create an SQL database. If I use JSON, the next web administrator who takes my place will only need to update the CSV file and upload it to the asp.net server in the directory where this map project resides. He or she will also need to make sure the Python script remains there. As far as the SQL approach, I need to ask iEngineering more about what version of SQL they are using before I attempt to create my own SQL database.
